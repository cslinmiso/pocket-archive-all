# Archive all article on pocket

somehow getpocket does not has the feature to archive all articles, let's implement it in nightwatch.js.

it only supports Mac now, feel free to send pull request to me!

## Install and run

```shell
npm install
# selenium and chrome-driver will be downloaded to selenium directory
npm start
# start selenium and nightwatch to automated execute script
```
